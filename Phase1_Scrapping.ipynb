    "Hellowork is identified as a **dynamic website**, where job offers are rendered\n",
    "dynamically rather than being fully embedded in static HTML pages. Consequently,\n",

    "## Phase 1 – Scraping Scope Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "### Search Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "To build a dataset suitable for large-scale business intelligence analysis and machine learning tasks, the scraping process targets a broad and representative set of job offers published on the Hellowork platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "The search criteria are intentionally defined in a **general and cross-domain manner**, covering multiple professional fields, including but not limited to:\n",
    "- Information Technology and digital professions\n",
    "- Engineering and technical roles\n",
    "- Business, management, and administration\n",
    "- Marketing, communication, and sales\n",
    "- Finance, accounting, and economics\n",
    "- Human resources and support functions\n",
    "\n",
    "The data collection relies on generic job search result pages without restrictive filters on job category, experience level, or contract type. This approach allows the aggregation of a diverse sample of job offers reflecting various sectors, seniority levels, and employment types.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure sufficient data volume for clustering, classification, and trend analysis, the scraping scope is designed to collect **at least 2,000 job offers**. This is achieved by iterating over multiple search result pages and aggregating offers across different categories and search queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Only currently available job offers are considered, and location information is preserved to support geographic analysis in later phases of the project.\n"

    "## Phase 1 – Scraping Workflow and Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "With the HTML structure and data fields defined, the scraping workflow is designed to extract all job offers efficiently and reliably while respecting ethical standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Workflow Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Set up Selenium WebDriver** (Chrome) with proper options:\n",
    "   - User-agent header\n",
    "   - Maximized window\n",
    "   - Optional headless mode\n",
    "2. **Access the search results page** for each sector.\n",
    "3. **Handle cookies banners** and other pop-ups to ensure uninterrupted scraping.\n",
    "4. **Iterate over each job listing on the page**:\n",
    "   - Extract job URL from the search results\n",
    "   - Open job detail page to scrape all defined data fields (`Job_Title`, `Company`, `Location`, `Contract`, `Salary`, `Description`, `URL`, `Sector`)\n",
    "   - Use **explicit waits** to ensure elements are loaded before extraction\n",
    "5. **Store extracted data** in a structured format (CSV)\n",
    "6. **Repeat for all pages** of each sector until the target of ≥ 2,000 job offers is reached\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Pagination Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each search result page contains multiple job listings (typically 20–25 per page)  \n",
    "- The scraper navigates through pages by **modifying the page number parameter** in the URL (`&p=page_number`)  \n",
    "- Iteration continues until:\n",
    "  - Enough job offers are collected (≥ 2,000)  \n",
    "  - No more pages are available or the page contains no job listings\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Error Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Missing fields**: optional fields (Salary, Contract) are stored as `\"N/A\"` or `None`  \n",
    "- **Timeouts / page load issues**: use Selenium **explicit waits** and retry logic for failed elements  \n",
    "- **Unexpected page structure**: log the issue and continue with remaining jobs  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Politeness and Ethics\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add a **delay of 0.5–3 seconds** between requests and job detail visits to avoid overloading the server  \n",
    "- Respect the website’s **robots.txt** and terms of use  \n",
    "- Scraping is performed **only for academic purposes**, not for commercial use  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Data Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extracted data is **saved incrementally** to `hellowork_progress.csv` to prevent loss in case of interruption  \n",
    "- Final dataset saved as `hellowork_final_sectors_data.csv`  \n",
    "- CSV encoding: UTF-8 to preserve special characters  \n",
    "- Data includes all defined fields and sector information, ready for **Phase 2 – ETL and Data Cleaning**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This workflow ensures:\n",
    "- Reliable extraction of ≥ 2,000 job offers across multiple sectors  \n",
    "- Structured and consistent dataset with all required fields  \n",
    "- Ethical, reproducible, and robust scraping process using Selenium  \n",
    "- Preparedness for subsequent **ETL, ML, and interactive dashboard** phases\n"
